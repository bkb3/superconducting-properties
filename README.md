# Superconducting properties
simple demonstration of superconducting and non superconducting state.
It  is possible to destroy the superconductivity of a superconductor by application of intense magnetic field. If a super conductor is placed in a sufficiently strong magnetic field the super conductor becomes a normal conductor i.e. it regains its resistance.  The value of magnic field at which superconductivity is destroyed is called the threshold or critical  magnetic field. It is denoted by Subscript[H, c] and is found to be a function of temperature. 
   If we plot a graph of critical magnic field versus temperature, the curve is approximately parabolic.  It is given by the relation
				Subscript[H, c] = Subscript[H, o][1 - (T/Subscript[T, c])^2]
where Subscript[H, o] is the critical magnetic field at 0 K.
  
 According to this relation,
				at O K  Subscript[H, c] = 
 Subscript[H, o] &  at T = Subscript[T, c] , Subscript[H, c] = 0
The curve defines the boundary below which superconductivity is present and outside it, 
the superconductivity behaves as a normal conductor. From the above, we conclude that the superconductor state is stable only in some definite ranges of magnetic field and temperatures.
